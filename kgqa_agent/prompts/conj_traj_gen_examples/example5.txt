Since the Denver Nuggets are an NBA team based in Denver, it is likely that they share this mascot.

OUTPUT:
<think>
The only relation for Rocky the Mountain Lion is related to team mascots. I will retrieve the triples for this relation to find out which team(s) Rocky the Mountain Lion is associated with. This will help me confirm if he is indeed the mascot for the Denver Nuggets or another team that Nate Robinson played for.
