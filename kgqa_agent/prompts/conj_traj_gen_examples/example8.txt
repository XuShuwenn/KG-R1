OUTPUT:
<think>
The results indicate that the character Ajla is portrayed in the film "In the Land of Blood and Honey," which is also directed by Angelina Jolie. This confirms that the movie featuring the character Ajila (Ajla) is indeed "In the Land of Blood and Honey." Since I have found the answer, I will format it accordingly.
