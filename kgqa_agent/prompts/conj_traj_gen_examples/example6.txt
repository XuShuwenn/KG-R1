OUTPUT:
<think>
Teklel Hafouli has two relations: "film.performance.character" and "film.film_character.portrayed_in_films." The second relation seems particularly relevant as it may link Teklel Hafouli to specific films in which the character appears. I will query the triples for this relation to identify any films associated with Teklel Hafouli.
