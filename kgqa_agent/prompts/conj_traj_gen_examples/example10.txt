OUTPUT:
<think>
Mary is associated with both Judaism and Catholicism. Given that Catholicism is one of the religions practiced in Indonesia, it is relevant to the question. Therefore, I can conclude that Mary is a notable figure in Catholicism, which is observed in Indonesia. I will now provide the answer.
