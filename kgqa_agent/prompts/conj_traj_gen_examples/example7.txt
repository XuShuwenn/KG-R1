OUTPUT:
<think>
The teams in the American League West include the Texas Rangers, California Angels, Oakland Athletics, Anaheim Angels, Seattle Mariners, Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, and Seattle Pilots. Since Tom Hicks owns the Texas Rangers and this team is in the American League West, it is the answer to the question. I will now provide the final answer.
