OUTPUT:
<think>
The results show that Nate Robinson has played for several teams, including the Golden State Warriors, Washington Huskies men's basketball, Boston Celtics, New York Knicks, Chicago Bulls, Oklahoma City Thunder, and Denver Nuggets. However, I need to determine which of these teams has a mascot named "Rocky." 

Next, I will explore the relations for "Rocky" to see if it is associated with a specific sports team. This should help identify the team that Nate Robinson is currently associated with that also matches the mascot.
