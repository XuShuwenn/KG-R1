OUTPUT:
<think>
The relations for "Germany" include various geographical and economic properties. The most relevant relations to find neighboring countries are "location.adjoining_relationship.adjoins" and "location.country.administrative_divisions". I will proceed to query the triples for "Germany" using these relations to find out which countries share borders with Germany.
