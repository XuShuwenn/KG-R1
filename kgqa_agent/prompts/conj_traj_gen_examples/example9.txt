OUTPUT:
<think>
The results confirm that Copenhagen is the capital of Denmark. Since Denmark is a neighboring country of Germany, I can now provide the answer to the question about which German neighboring country has Copenhagen as its capital. 

The relevant neighboring country is Denmark. I will format this answer according to the instructions.
