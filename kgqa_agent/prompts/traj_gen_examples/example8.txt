OUTPUT:
<think>
The relevant relation I found for "Tennessee Williams" is "education.education.student," which likely relates to the educational institutions he attended. Since we need to find the college he went to that has a football team named Iowa Hawkeyes, I will now query for the triples associated with this relation.
