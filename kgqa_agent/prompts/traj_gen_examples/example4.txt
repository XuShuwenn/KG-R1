OUTPUT:
<think>
The relations retrieved for "Netherlands" include "language.human_language.main_country" and "language.human_language.countries_spoken_in", which are likely to provide information about the language(s) spoken in the Netherlands. I will query for the triples using these relations to find out the specific language spoken in the Netherlands.
