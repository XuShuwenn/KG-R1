OUTPUT:
<think>
The relations obtained for "CFP franc" include "finance.currency.countries_used" and "location.country.currency_used." Both relations seem relevant for identifying which countries use the CFP franc. I will query the triples for "CFP franc" using these relations to find the specific countries that utilize this currency.
