The relations I found for "Adam Sandler" include various connections to films, such as the films he acted in and those he wrote or produced. To find the specific film where he played a character named "Ginger," I will retrieve the triples for "Adam Sandler" using the relevant relations related to films: "film.performance.actor" and "film.actor.film". This will help me identify the films he has acted in and check if any of them feature a character named Ginger.
